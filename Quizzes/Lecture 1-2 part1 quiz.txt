Lecture 1-2: Public Interfaces

1. How can you use the methods of the public interface to empty emilysChecking bankaccount?

Answer: 
BankAccount emilysChecking = new BankAccount(500000);
		double bal = emilysChecking.getBalannce();
		emilysChecking.withdraw(bal);
OR
BankAccount emilysChecking = new BankAccount(500000);
		emilysChecking.withdraw(emilysChecking.getBalannce());

2. Suppose you want a more powerful bank account abstraction that keeps track of an  account number in addition to the balance. How would you change the public interface to accommodate this enhancement?

Answer: 
You could add the accountNumber like this:
public BankAccount(int accountNumber){}
public BankAccount(double initialBalance, int accountNumber) {}
public int getAccountNumber(){}
