## Important notes

--> Any program in java, must have a class, 
	which is a collection of data items and methods.
--> Java is an Object Oriented Language.
--> Must have a main(), it's the starting function 
	(entry point). 
--> Java is case-sensitive
--> A Package is a collection of related classes
--> Three types of errors:
	1. Syntax Error --> for example forgetting ; or " " or (), basically,
	   any mistake in the code (spotted at compile time!!).
	   
	2. Runtime Error --> for example dividing by zero, such an unexpected error 
	   that causes the program to abort. 
	
	3. Logic Error --> this happens when the output is not what is expected to be
