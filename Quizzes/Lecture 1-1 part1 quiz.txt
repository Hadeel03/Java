Lecture 1-1: Variable Declarations

1. What is wrong with the following variable declaration?

int miles per gallon = 39.4

Answer:
* Name has spaces
* int but it's a double
* Missing a ; 


2. Declare and initialize two variables,

unitPrice
and
quantity 
to contain the unit price of a single item and the number of items purchased. Use reasonable initial values.

Answer: 

double unitPrice = 1.95;
int quantity = 5;

3. Use the variables declared in the last question to display the total purchase price, with some explanatory text, all in one line.

System.out.print("Total price: " + unitPrice * quantity);
